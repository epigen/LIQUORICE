v0.5.0
    Complete re-fractoring and overhaul.
v0.5.1
    Various minor bugfixes and improvements.
v0.5.2
    Improved ray import handling
v0.5.3
    Make ray-core an optional dependency in meta.yaml and provide details on this in docs
v0.5.4
    LIQUORICE_summary now handles samples with numerical names correctly
v0.5.5
    Fixes a bug so that now when --save_biasfactor_table is specified, the corrected coverage is saved as well. Adds the --save_corrected_coverage_table flag/parameter.
v0.5.6
    Fixes a bug due to which, when reads with a template length (column 9 in the .bam file) of 0 were provided, in some cases the coverage calculation would fail with the error "AssertionError: fragment start greater than fragmentend for read <read name>".
    Fragments are now assumed to be not "properly paired" when their insert size length is 0. This may slightly change the results of LIQUORICE in cases were reads with template lengths of 0 were provided.
